# SQL Study Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains my notes and exercises as I learn SQL. It's intended as a personal reference, but I hope it might be useful to other learners as well.

## Contents

- `Basics/`: This directory contains notes on SQL basics, such as syntax, data types, and basic queries.
- `Intermediate/`: This directory includes topics like joins, subqueries, and set operations.
- `Advanced/`: Here you'll find more complex topics like stored procedures, triggers, and optimization.

## Resources

Here are some of the resources I've found helpful in my studies:

- SQLZoo: Interactive SQL tutorials.
- W3Schools SQL Tutorial: A comprehensive SQL tutorial with examples.
